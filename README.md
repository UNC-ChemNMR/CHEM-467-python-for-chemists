# CHEM 467 python for chemists

This repository contains course material for UNC CHEM 467.

In this repository, we will learn how Python can be used by chemists to:
* perform cheminformatics
* analyze NMR data
* generate data visualizations

The course material will consist of in-class and take-home interactive Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb).
We will be using a UNC research computing resource called Longleaf to run the Jupyter notebooks for this class. 

## Tasks to complete before you can start coding

1) Acquire a Longleaf account
    * Note: Requests for Longleaf accounts take 1 day to be approved.
    * [Instructions for getting Longleaf access](setup/1-get-longleaf-access.md)
2) Setup Jupyter via Longleaf
    * This will teach you how to use Jupyter in addition to installing the course materials and required software packages to your Longleaf account.
    * [Complete the instructions for setting up Jupyter via Longleaf On Demand](setup/2-setup-jupyter-via-longleaf.md)
